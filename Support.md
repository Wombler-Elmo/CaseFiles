Q: How do I play?
A: Once you launch a case, you’ll be guided step by step around the historical site. Your mission is to find hidden locations, uncover missing pieces, and solve puzzles. Don’t worry if you get stuck — there are clues along the way! If you get really stuck, you can give up on that puzzle and move to the next one, with a 5-minute time penalty.

Q: How long do cases take?
A: Most cases take around 60-90 minutes, depending on your team size and how many clues you use. But don't worry, it's all about having fun and discovering history along the way!

Q: Do I need internet to play?
A: No - Once the app is downloaded the cases are already ready to go! You only need GPS to play. 

Q: Can I pause the case?
A: Yes! You can pause the case at any time, your in game timer will also pause and you can resume as soon as you're ready.

Q: Do you have an instagram to find out about new cases?

Q: What if the app doesn't unlock a case?
A: Make sure you're within 100m of the site and your phone has location permissions enabled.
